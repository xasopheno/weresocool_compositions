Great! I'm glad you found the updated prompts satisfactory. Now, let's move on to creating TypeScript code examples for each step of the process. I will explain each step and ensure you understand before moving on to the next one.

For this task, we'll assume that you're using the OpenAI API and have installed the @openai/client package from npm. Make sure you have your API key handy.

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up the OpenAI client:

typescript
Copy code
import { OpenAIClient, CreateCompletionRequest } from '@openai/client';

const openai = new OpenAIClient('<YOUR_API_KEY>');
Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual API key.

Now, let's create a function to send prompts to the OpenAI API:

typescript
Copy code
async function sendPrompt(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
  const request: CreateCompletionRequest = {
    engine: 'text-davinci-003',
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens: 150,
    n: 1,
    stop: null,
    temperature: 0.8,
  };

  try {
    const response = await openai.createCompletion(request);
    return response.choices[0].text.trim();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return '';
  }
}
Now we can start implementing each step:

Step 0: Summarizing the written content
Create a function to summarize the content:

typescript
Copy code
async function summarizeContent(text: string): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `Summarize the key events, characters, and themes of the following text as bullet points. Keep the summary concise and informative.

Text: """
${text}
"""`;

  const summary = await sendPrompt(prompt);
  return summary;
}
Step 1: Writing a new chapter
Create a function to write a new chapter:

typescript
Copy code
async function writeNewChapter(summaries: string, previousChapters: string): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `Using the context provided below, write a new chapter for a captivating love story set in the future.
    The writing style should resemble Kurt Vonnegut but also draw inspiration from Steven King, Stanislaw Lem, and
    Isaac Asimov. Make it a page-turner that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. a chapters length should be between 1,500 words—or six book pages— and 8,000 words, or 32 book pages

Context:
- Summaries: ${summaries}
- Previous chapters: ${previousChapters}`;

  const newChapter = await sendPrompt(prompt);
  return newChapter;
}
Step 2: Editing the new chapter
Create a function to edit the new chapter:

typescript
Copy code
async function editChapter(newChapter: string): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `Review the following chapter and provide suggestions for improvement in terms of flow, style, and coherence. Ensure that the writing style remains consistent and engaging.

Chapter:
${newChapter}`;

  const editSuggestions = await sendPrompt(prompt);
  return editSuggestions;
}
Step 3: Improving the chapter
Create a function to improve the chapter:

typescript
Copy code
async function improveChapter(newChapter: string, editSuggestions: string): Promise<string> {
  const prompt = `Incorporate the suggestions provided below to rewrite and enhance the chapter. Maintain the engaging and thought-provoking style throughout the revised chapter.

Edit suggestions:
${editSuggestions}

Original chapter:
${newChapter}`;

  const improvedChapter = await sendPrompt(prompt);
  return improvedChapter;
}
These functions implement the steps you described, using the updated prompts. To create the book, you can call these functions in a loop, store the finalized chapters, and use the summaries to
